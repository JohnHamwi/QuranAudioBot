# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

In the spirit of Islamic values of respect, kindness, and brotherhood, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Akhlaq (Good Character)**: Demonstrating good character and manners in all interactions
- **Respect**: Using welcoming and inclusive language
- **Empathy**: Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- **Constructive Feedback**: Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- **Community Focus**: Focusing on what is best for the community
- **Responsibility**: Showing empathy towards other community members
- **Islamic Etiquette**: Following Islamic principles of conduct in discussions

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Disrespecting Islamic values or making inappropriate comments about religion
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Project-Specific Guidelines

Given that this is a Quran-related project:

- **Respect for Sacred Content**: All discussions and contributions should maintain respect for the Quran and Islamic teachings
- **Educational Purpose**: Remember this project serves the Muslim Ummah and should be treated with appropriate reverence
- **Constructive Contributions**: Focus on improving the project to better serve users in their spiritual practice
- **No Support Policy**: Respect the project's "take as-is" policy and do not demand support or responses

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

### No Support Policy Notice

**Important**: This project follows a strict "No Support" policy. While we expect respectful behavior, please note:

- Violations may result in removal of content or blocking without warning
- No discussions or appeals regarding enforcement actions will be entertained
- The maintainers reserve the right to take any action they deem appropriate

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
