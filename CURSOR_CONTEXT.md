# Cursor AI Assistant Context for QuranBot Project

## Project Overview
- **Project Name:** QuranBot/QuranAudioBot
- **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/JohnHamwi/QuranAudioBot
- **Developer Email:** john.hamwi10@gmail.com
- **Current Version:** v1.1.0
- **Platform:** Discord Bot for Quran audio playback

## User Preferences & Requirements

### Development Preferences
- **Never run multiple bot instances simultaneously** - Bot includes built-in instance detection
- **Every file must include logging, debugging, and error handling** - Comprehensive tracebacks and logs required
- **Tree structured (tree/JSON-like) logs** for readability in every file
- **Minimal, targeted edits** - Don't replace entire files during refactoring
- **Periodic progress updates** on ongoing tasks

### Deployment Preferences
- **Commands should only be run on VPS, not local machine**
- **Never move data folder to VPS** - Avoid overriding stored information
- **Never override or overwrite data on VPS** during operations

### Feature Preferences
- **Use `/leaderboard` instead of `/quranleaderboard`** for Quran MCQ leaderboard
- **Arabic and English text in separate black boxes** for question embeds (similar to verse embeds)

## Project Structure & Key Files

### Core Files
- `main.py` - Main bot entry point with instance detection
- `bot_manager.py` - Bot management utility (start/stop/restart/status)
- `src/utils/tree_log.py` - Tree-structured logging system
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies (discord.py, python-dotenv, etc.)

### Configuration
- `.env` - Single configuration file (not committed to repo)
- `env_template.txt` - Template for environment variables
- Uses `python-dotenv` for environment variable loading

### Logging System
- **Run Separation:** Each bot run gets unique ID (e.g., `DB257D45`)
- **Visual Separators:** 80-character lines between runs
- **Tree Structure:** Hierarchical logging with emojis and indentation
- **Line Breaks:** Automatic spacing between tree sections
- **Daily Log Files:** Organized by date in `logs/` directory

## Recent Implementation Details

### Instance Management
- Built-in process detection prevents multiple instances
- Automatic cleanup of existing instances with user confirmation
- Bot manager utility for easy start/stop/restart operations

### Logging Enhancements
- **Run ID System:** Unique 8-character hex IDs for each run
- **Run Headers:** Detailed start information with timestamp, version, run ID
- **Section Spacing:** Automatic blank lines between tree sections
- **Run End Logging:** Completion tracking with reason codes

### GitHub Repository Features
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` excluding sensitive files
- Professional README with badges and setup instructions
- MIT License included
- GitHub releases with version tags (v1.1.0, v1.1.1)
- Security-focused approach with no sensitive data exposure

## Current State
- Bot successfully connects to Discord and plays audio
- Voice channel connection working (`ðŸ•‹â”ƒQuran` channel)
- Audio playback from `audio/Saad Al Ghamdi` folder
- 114 audio files detected and playing
- Instance detection and management fully functional
- Enhanced logging with run separation and spacing

## Development Environment
- **Python Dependencies:** discord.py, python-dotenv
- **External Dependencies:** FFmpeg for audio processing
- **Discord API:** Voice connection and audio streaming
- **Log Format:** Tree-structured with EST timestamps

## Key Functions in tree_log.py
- `log_run_separator()` - Creates run separators
- `log_run_header()` - Logs run start information
- `log_run_end()` - Logs run completion
- `log_spacing()` - Adds section spacing
- `log_tree()` - Main tree logging function
- `log_info()`, `log_success()`, `log_error()` - Specific log types

## Mac Migration Notes
- Pull latest from GitHub: `git pull origin master`
- Create `.env` file using `env_template.txt` as reference
- Ensure FFmpeg is installed and accessible
- Run bot with: `python main.py`
- Use bot manager: `python bot_manager.py status/start/stop/restart`
